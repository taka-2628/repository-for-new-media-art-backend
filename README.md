# Phase 3 Project: Baby Logbook

 This project is a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database. This API is created for [Repository for New Media Art](https://github.com/taka-2628/repository-for-new-media-art), a React frontend application that I designed and built for digital artists and creators.

This application was created with a react front end and a ruby and sinatra back end.

## Background

Repository for New Media Art is an online repository for digital art. It is a platform for creators to showcase their projects and learn from other creatives. Artists and creators can find artistic inspirations as well as technical solutions here. Each project has a comment section where people can discuss, connect or ask the author questions.
